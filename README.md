<**IN PROGRESS**>

A collection of (discrete time) latent Markov model implementations written in python. 

The intention was to port the dynamicalSystems MATLAB repo into python. However, I'm taking a step back to think more carefully about what this should look like. For instance, to what extent can we now take advantage of automatic differentiation tools? I'm hoping to develop this further once I have a better idea of where I'm going, but for the time being this is just a record of some time series stuff in python that will serve as a useful reference for me.
